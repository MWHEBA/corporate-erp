Governance Signals Package

This package contains thin signal adapters for various business workflows.
All signals are designed to handle non-critical side effects only, with
business logic remaining in dedicated service classes.

Key Principles:
- Thin adapters only (no business logic in signals)
- Feature flag protection for safe rollback
- Non-critical side effects only
- Signal independence (failures don't break writes)
- Integration with SignalRouter governance

Available Signal Modules:
- payroll_signals: Payroll workflow signal adapters
- auto_activation: Auto-activation signals for Governance
